# Drawing

A canvas-based drawing app in TypeScript.

Here are some of the points we'll cover.

## DOM

- How script will run before/after DOM content depending on where it's placed in HTML
- How to get values from input elements
- Getting positions from mouse events
- Event bubbling
- Implementing drag gestures
- Mouse events vs. touch events
- Coordinates, bounding rects, etc
- stopPropagation & preventDefault
- setTimeout vs. setInterval vs. raf
- Canvas & imperative APIs
- Global event handlers
- Mention css vendor prefixing

## TS

- How imports/exports work
- How multiple files are bundled (the main idea, at least)
- How types like Point/Rect can be objects or classes, each with pros and cons
- Enums vs unions vs discriminated types
- Converting to/from string-backed enums
- Type guards
- Type assertions
- Using classes - initializers, methods, properties, etc
